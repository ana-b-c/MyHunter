# MyHunter

# The project:
In this project, you are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of Duck Hunt.
The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:

  ✓ the player is a hunter who shoots ducks.
  
  ✓ ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.

  ✓ the player can click on them to shoot them.

Being able to manage inputs from the user and to display animated sprites are key skills when
you want to develop basic games.

You will reuse your work for other video game projects, so think about it to make it the
most scalable way.

Your project should of course fit the requirements below but we are expecting it to be more than
just a technical demonstration: we want you to think about it as a real game.
